"June 29, 2019","Trade talks to restart, ban on Huawei relaxed","Both","5","
The US and China agreed to restart trade talks, following the tentative truce reached earlier in the week. No deadline has been imposed for the talks unlike the 90-day ceasefire agreed to last year at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires. This means that a new round of tit-for-tat tariffs will remain on hold for the foreseeable future.

More interestingly, President Trump also suggested relaxing the ban on US exports to China’s Huawei Technologies.

Both announcements bring immediate relief to Chinese trade negotiators who will now be keenly following the 2020 US elections.

During his press conference, Trump appeared short on specifics besides clarifying, “We’re holding back on tariffs” and stating that US companies were “not exactly happy” about being unable to sell to the Chinese smartphone maker. Previously, the US had blacklisted the company by placing it on its ‘entity list’ and banned the sale of high-tech components and software to Huawei."

    Shifts in China’s Industrial Supply Chain and the US-China Trade War

Originally scheduled to take place over two days, the discussions extended a day further after many issues remained unresolved. China’s top economic adviser Liu He also made a surprise appearance at the talks, which were intended to be at a vice-ministerial level only.

The discussions were divided into two areas – ‘trade issues’, which included trade imbalances in certain sectors and ‘structural issues’, such as forced technology transfers, intellectual property protection, and non-tariff barriers.

After the talks, China’s Commerce Ministry issued a statement that the talks were “extensive and established a foundation for the resolution of each other’s concerns.”

The USTR issued a statement announcing China’s pledge to purchase a “substantial amount of agricultural, energy, manufactured goods, and other products and services from the US”, but noted that several outstanding issues remain. The official statement can be found here.

The suspension of these tariffs will affect 144 auto products as well as 67 auto-parts and marks the first concrete concession since the 90-day trade war truce made at the G20 Buenos Aires Leaders’ Summit. The official announcement can be found here.
